# Deployment Documentation

## Deploying to Azure
Azure docs for various services are very useful for this. You will need an Azure account, which with a wm.edu email, will also give access to the [Azure for Students subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/), which will give $100 of Azure credits.
