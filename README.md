# CollegeTalk

There's a lot that goes into college life for a student, but student's don't always get the information they need. CollegeTalk is an application for students to communicate with each other, giving them a space to ask questions and discuss topics freely and without judgement. This consolidates many other communication platforms that are currently being used within the student body, and provides a dedicated space for students to get their questions answered.Â
